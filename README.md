## ðŸ“Œ The Situation

Maven Fuzzy Factory has been live for ~8 months, and your CEO is due to present company performance metrics to the board next week. Youâ€™ll be the one tasked with preparing relevant metrics to show the companyâ€™s promising growth.

## ðŸ“Œ The Objective

Use SQL to :
Extract and analyze website traffic and performance data from the Maven Fuzzy Factory database to quantify the companyâ€™s growth, and to tell the story of how you have been able to generate that growth.

## ðŸ“Œ Questions

ðŸ’¡**1 - Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?**

#### Steps:

- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders where source is gsearch
- Aggregate to find conversion rate for every month 

#### Query:

![](images/query_1.png)

#### Result:

![](images/result_1.png)

- Session to order growth remained stable and saw a steady increase from March (3.23%) to November (4.20%).

ðŸ’¡**2 - Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.**

#### Steps:

- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders based on source is gsearch
- Aggregate to find conversion rate for every month based on campaign

#### Query:

![](images/query_2.png)

#### Result:

![](images/result_2.png)

- We can see that the percentage of conversion rate of nonbrand campaign steadily grows from 3% to 4%. But, the brand campaign has fluctuating conversion rates/trends every month.

ðŸ’¡**3 - While weâ€™re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.**

#### Steps:

- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders based on source is gsearch
- Aggregate to find nonbrand conversion rate for every month based on device type

#### Query:

![](images/query_3.png)

#### Result:

![](images/result_3.png)

- The majority of the conversion rate contribution came from desktop users with a good growth from 4.43% in March, it dropped in April to 3.51%, but continued to increase in the following months to reach 5% in November. The contribution with mobile devices is quite low and there is a need to investigate this, it could be that the web accessed through mobile is not user friendly.


ðŸ’¡**4 - Iâ€™m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?**

#### Steps:

- Find the various utm sources and refers to see the traffic we're getting
- Extract months and aggregate to find each session based on the last output condition

#### Query:

![](images/query_4.png)

![](images/result_4.png)

From the output we can see:

- Source of traffic from gsearch and bsearch
- Based on the output :
   - If source, campaign, and http referral is NULL, then it is direct traffic: users type in the website link in the browser's search bar
   - If source and campaign is NULL, but there is http referral, then it is organic search: coming from search engine and not tagged with paid parameters

![](images/query_4_1.png)

![](images/result_4_1.png)

- Gsearch is the dominant traffic among other channels. Not only gsearch, each channel also experiences session growth every month.

ðŸ’¡**5 - Iâ€™d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?**

#### Steps:

- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders
- Aggregate to find conversion rate for every month sessions

#### Query:

![](images/query_5.png)

#### Result:

![](images/result_5.png)

- The conversion rate in March was 3.19% and decreased in the next month. The conversion rate started to increase steadily in the following month until it reached 4.40% in November.

ðŸ’¡**6 - For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us (Hint: Look at the increase in CVR from the test (Jun 19 â€“ Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)**

#### Steps:

- Find lander-1 test was created and the first website_pageview_id, retricting to home and lander-1
- Create summary, join the result with order_id and aggregat for session, order, and cvr
- Find most recent pageview for gsearch nonbrand where traffic was sent to /home and estimate revenue that test earned from lander-1

#### Query:

![](images/query_6.png)

![](images/result_6.png)

![](images/query_6_1.png)

![](images/result_6_1.png)

- The home page conversion rate is 3.18% and lander-1 is 4.06%. The incremental difference in website performance is 1.08% using lander-1.

![](images/query_6_2.png)

![](images/result_6_2.png)

- We can estimate the increase in revenue from the increase in orders:
    - 22972 session x 1.08% (incremental % of order) = 248
    - So, estimated at least 248 incremental orders since 29 Jul using the lander-1 page
- Calculate monthly increase (July - November):
    - 248 / 4 = 64 additional order/month

ðŸ’¡**7 - Iâ€™d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?**

#### Steps:

- Check pageview_url from two pages was created and create summary all pageviews for relevant session
- Categorise website sessions under segment by 'saw_home_page' or 'saw_lander_page' and aggregate data to assess funnel performance
- Convert aggregated result to percentage of click rate

#### Query:

![](images/query_7_2.png)

![](images/result_7_2.png)

![](images/query_7_3.png)

![](images/result_7_3.png)

- Lander-1 page has a better click trough rate than the home page.

ðŸ’¡**8 - Iâ€™d love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 â€“ Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.**

#### Steps:

- Check billing-2 test was created
- Calculate or aggregate the sessions and price_usd for /billing and /billing-2
- Calculate billing page sessions for the past month (Sep 27 â€“ Nov 27) and estimate revenue

#### Query:

![](images/query_8.png)

![](images/result_8.png)

- billing-2 has a larger revenue per billing page contribution with a lift of 8.51 dollars/pageview

![](images/query_8_1.png)

![](images/result_8_1.png)

- We can calculate from the past month:
    - Total session a month = 1193
    - Value billing test = 1193 X 8.51 (lift) = 10152.43
- So there are 1193 sessions and with the increase of 8.51 dolar average revenue per session with a positive impact 10152.43 dolar increase in revenue
